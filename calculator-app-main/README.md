## My process

- Create a draft of the web App
- Create a header section, a screen display section, and a keyboard section
- Section Keyboard into rows for easy flex box arrangement on CSS
- Structure the calculator with responsive keys on CSS
- Determine theme adjustment mechanism
- Create default CSS colour variables


Finally- for JavaScript:

- Create an array to hold the colour hex code for the various themes
- Write functions to access the colour palette according to the user theme
- Access all keys using the addEventListener and querySelectAll methods on the DOM
- Furthermore, using the eval function, evaluate inputted math statements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I utilized the inbuilt javaScript Math.eval function

I also implemented the try-catch clause

It was interesting to figure out how to change the calculator theme

### Continued development

As part of my 20-frontendMentor project challenge series, here is project 11 of 20 ... yaay!

I have now started to learn the Reactjs framework. I can't wait to see how this project would be

carried out differently.
